# Working with Plotly

This program reads a dataset containing GDP, life expectancy, and population data for countries in 2007 and represents it using a Plotly scatter plot. The graph visualizes the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, with bubble size indicating population and color representing the continent. The data is presented on a logarithmic scale for GDP, allowing for a better comparison of countries with varying economic sizes. The interactive plot allows users to hover over countries to see additional information like the country name and continent.
